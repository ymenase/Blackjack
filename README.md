# Blackjack

Blackjack is a card game where the objective is to have the player's cards equal 21. Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on the player's other cards. This Java program is a computer simulaton where players take turns. With additional time, I would incorporate betting and additional decks and perhaps create a more entertaining UI.
